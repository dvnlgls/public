## Before you join.

Hi, thanks for your interest in joining our Club, aptly named **The Royal Literature Club**! 

As of Feb 17th, we have had three meetings so far and another scheduled in March.

While we've welcomed new members so far, after a few meetings a pattern has emerged. Most people only say they are interested in a book club but never participate i.e.: not even bothering to vote on meeting polls, voice their opinions etc.

So we'll explain a few things about the Club, and you can decide if this is something that might interest you.

#### There are 2 things you must know about the Club:

1) A regular meeting happens on the 2nd Saturday of every month, at BAnQ (the library near Berri), usually from 2pm to 4pm. It's not set in stone but most people seem to like this venue & schedule. Some of us have expressed interest in arranging informal meetings too. 

2) Members are always encouraged to organize their own meetings that suit their own schedule. The subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalLitClub/) provides a platform to do so. But so far no one has bothered to try that, but we don't complain. Since this is a new club, we want to see how things shape up.

About the meetings themselves: For the second and the third meetings we decided to read a short story beforehand and discuss it. We very much enjoyed it and decided to keep it that way for the foreseeable future. We have polls to decide the book to read.

In reality the required reading only serves as a talking point and the discussions branch into many interesting topics, depends on the members in attendance. Otherwise we have no rigid rules. No compulsion to read beforehand etc.

So, if this is something that interests you and you're confident you can participate actively, please go to **https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalLitClub/** and send us a request. Thanks.
